Picklr
======

*This is a work in progress and may behave unexpectedly. Please don't use this for now, and instead use PickledChat from http://hypixel.net/threads/114069/

This is a client modification providing utilities for users of the Hypixel Minecraft server. It's the successor to PickledChat, which has had about 300 downloads of the most recent version as of the time of writing.

This is a total rewrite of PickledChat in order to allow for better expandability - PickledChat was never designed to grow to the size it has, and the fast development has meant that the best way to ensure a sustainable future was to totally rewrite PickledChat.

Bearing in mind that, at launch, Picklr contains the same features as PickledChat, it is allowed, as PickledChat was.

Downloading and installing
---------------------------

Picklr can either be built from source or builds can be downloaded from the Hypixel Forums thread (link coming soon).

PickledChat documentation is mostly contained within the source code. However, users may be interested in viewing the wiki for information pertaining to:

- The various online features of the modification
